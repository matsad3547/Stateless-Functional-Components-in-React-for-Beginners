# React Stateless Function Components

If you would like to follow along with this presentation, please fork and clone this repo, run `$ npm install`, and when that finishes, run `$ npm start`.  This way, you will be able to see your changes live.

This repo contains a todo app ([modeled after this one](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todos) - Thank you all very much!) both with standard React "class" components and a second version where state is lifted up and passed as props to the relative components.  

When learning React, I learned about stateless functional components (hereafter SFC's) on my own and it took me a little while to understand their power.  I find them much simpler and easier to use.  Plus they are _just_ functions!
